# Class to represent a graph
# This class must have the following interface:
# Constructor creates an empty graph, no parameters.
# addVertex(value)  adds vertex to the graph
# addEdge(v1, v2, weight) adds edge from v1 to v2 with a certain weight
# getWeight(v1, v2) returns weight of an edge between v1 and v2, if the edge does not exist returns -1
# Dijkstra algorithm will be added in future
